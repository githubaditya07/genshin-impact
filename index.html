        <h1> Genshin impact</h1>
        <p>
            Genshin Impact[a] is an action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Android, and iOS in September 2020, PlayStation 5 in April 2021, and is planned for future release on Nintendo Switch. The game features an anime style open-world environment and an action-based battle system. The game is free-to-play and is monetized through gacha game mechanics. While developed after Honkai Impact 3rd (2016) with a similar naming scheme, Genshin Impact is not a sequel.

            Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, which is home to seven distinct nations,[b] each of which is tied to a different element[c] and ruled by a different god.[d] The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated in Teyvat. The Traveler travels in search of their lost sibling with their companion Paimon, all the while becoming involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations.
            
            Development took the better part of 4 years from early 2017 to 2020. To supplement the game, miHoYo released a companion manga, with further plans for tie-in media. The game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the combat and open-world, while others criticized its shallow endgame and monetization model. A commercial success, the game grossed over $2 billion in its first year of release.
